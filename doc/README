File TraceTunerPremium2_0.pdf contains the Manual for TraceTuner 2.0
Premium version.

IMPORTANT!!! 

1) To view the PDF Manual properly, you must use Acrobat Reader version 4 
   or higher

2) We do not recommended installing TraceTuner on the PCs that directly 
   control the ABI sequencers.

If you invoke ttuner without arguments, you get a brief usage message

where 
    -h (Optional) Displays the detailed help message.

    -Q (Optional) (quiet) Turns off ttuner's status messages.

    -V (Optional) (verbose)  Specifies that TraceTuner produce additional
        process status messages. The default (without either the -Q or -V
        option) is level 1. The more V's entered on the command line, 
        the higher the level of verbosity. 
        After level 3 (-VV), there is no change in verbosity. 
        If used in conjunction with the -Q option, the parameter 
        that appears last on the command line takes precedence.

    -nocall (Optional) This parameter disables TraceTuner base calling and 
        sets the current sequence to the base calls that are read from the 
        input file.  By default, the current sequence is set to the TraceTuner
        base calls.  This parameter cannot be used together with -recalln. 
        If you use -nocall, you will get Ns. 
        If you don't use -nocall, you will not get Ns.

    -recalln (Optional) This parameter specifies to recall Ns, but not to 
        change, insert or delete any other bases. 
        All bases are relocated to the positions of corresponding peaks. 
        This option cannot be used together with -nocall.

    -edited_bases (Optional) This option forces TraceTuner to read edited
        base calls and locations from sample file(s) and "start" from them 
        when recalling bases. By default, TraceTuner reads and starts from 
        called bases and locations. 

    -shift (Optional) This option forces TraceTuner to correct mobility shifts
        in traces.

    -convolved (Optional) This option forces TraceTuner to use the 'convolved'
        model of peak shape instead of the 'gaussian' model, which is used by
        default. 

    -snp (Optional) Specifies that TraceTuner make heterozygous base calls. 
        IUB Nucleotide Codes are used when making heterozygous base calls. 

    -min_ratio <phr> (Optional) Specifies a threshold ratio of heights of two 
        peaks which may be eventually called as heterozygotes. This parameter 
        will be used only when -snp option is additionally specified.
        If the actual ratio of heights of two peaks is less than the specified
        threshold, then this pair of peaks will not be considered as candidate
        for heterozygous base call. The default value for min_ratio is 0.15

    -t <lookup_table> (Optional) Instructs TraceTuner to use the specified 
        "external" calibration lookup table. This option overrides the default 
        (automatic selection of the lookup table) as well as the options -pop5,
        -pop6, -3100, -377dp and -377dt. To get a message indicating which 
        table was actually used, specify -V option

    -C <consensus_file> (Optional) Specifies the file which contains
        FASTA-formatted correct/reference sequence. If either the -tal or 
        -tald <dir> option is additionally used, then TraceTuner will
        align the sequence of its base calls with the correct sequence and 
        output the result into .tal file

    -cv3 (Optional) This flag works only with the -c or -cd option. It forces 
        ttuner to output version 3 of .scf files. The default output 
        of .scf files is version 2.

    -pop5 (Optional) Instructs TraceTuner to use the ABI3700_Pop5_BigDye 
        calibration table regardless of the chemistry used to generate the 
        processed sample file. By default, TraceTuner will automatically select 
        the lookup table from the list of five built-in tables. 

    -pop6 (Optional) Analogous to the -pop5 parameter, but for the 
        ABI3700_Pop6_BigDye calibration table. 

    -3100 (Optional) Analogous to the -pop5 parameter, but for the 
        ABI3100_Pop6_BigDye calibration table. 

    -377dp (Optional) Analogous to the -pop5 parameter, but for the ABI377_DP 
        (Dye Primer) calibration table. 

    -377dt (Optional) Analogous to the -pop5 parameter, but for the ABI377_DT 
        (Dye Terminator) calibration table. 

    -trim_window <window_size> (Optional) Specifies the size of the moving 
        average of bases used to trim the ends of a sequence. The default size 
        is 10. Trimming stops when the moving average of the quality values 
        reaches min_average_quality. Trim data are stored in the .phd output 
        file. 

    -trim_threshold <min_average_quality> (Optional) Specifies the threshold 
        for the aforementioned quality value moving average. The default value 
        is 20. 

    -p Specifies that TraceTuner output be written to .phd-formatted files in 
        the current working (i.e. sample file) directory. Note that .phd files 
        are needed to utilize the Viewer. 

    -pd <dir> Analogous to -p, but output file is written to the specified 
        directory. 

    -q Specifies that TraceTuner write one .qual-formatted quality value output
        file for each sample file to the sample file directory.

    -qd <dir> Analogous to -q, but output file is written to the specified 
        directory. 

    -qa <file> Specifies that TraceTuner aggregate the quality value output for
        all sample files into a single .qual-formatted output file and write 
        the output to the specified file. 

    -c Specifies that TraceTuner output results in a .scf-formatted file in the
        sample file directory. 

    -cd <dir> Analogous to -c, but output file is written to the specified 
        directory. 

    -s Specifies that TraceTuner write its (potentially) recalled bases in one 
        FASTA-formatted sequence file for each sample file in the sample file 
        directory. 

    -sd <dir> Analogous to -s, but output file is written to the specified 
        directory. 

    -sa <file> Specifies that TraceTuner aggregate its (potentially) recalled 
        bases for all sample files into a single FASTA-formatted sequence file 
        containing multiple sequences and write the output to the specified 
        file. 

    -d  Specifies that TraceTuner write out a .poly file that is used for 
        detecting polymorphic bases. 

    -dd <dir> Analogous to -d, but output file is written to the specified 
        directory. 

    -qr <output_file> Specifies that TraceTuner write a report file containing 
        statistics on the number of input files that contain bases with QV > 20
        to the specified file. The format of the will be similar to that of 
        qvreport.txt. 

    -tal Specifies that TraceTuner align its base calls with the bases in 
        <consensus_file> and output the results in a file with .tal extension 
        in the sample file directory. The Viewer requires .tal files in order 
        to display the reference sequences. 

    -tald <dir> Analogous to -tal, but results are written to a file in the 
        specified directory. 

    -tab Specifies that TraceTuner output the alternative base calls in a 
        file with .tab extension in the sample file directory. The Viewer 
        requires .tab files in order to display TraceTuner alternative base 
        calls. This option works only together with -snp option  

    -tabd <dir> Analogous to -tab, but results are written to a file in the 
        specified directory. 

    -ipd <dir> Instructs TraceTuner to read the original base calls and 
        locations from .phd.1-formatted file(s) rather than from sample 
        file(s). The .phd file(s) should be located in the specified 
        directory <phd_dir> and have name(s) which matches the name(s) 
        of the input sample file(s). This option allows using Phred's base 
        calls and locations or starting from them when recalling bases. 

    -id <dir> Specifies that TraceTuner process every file in the specified 
        directory. 

    -if <file_of_files> Specifies that TraceTuner read file_of_files and treat 
        each line as a sample filename. An example of a file_of_files is as 
        follows: 

        /home/username/ttuner/test_data/data_file1 
        /home/username/ttuner/test_data/data_file2 
        /home/username/ttuner/test_data/data_file3


You must specify at least one of the -p, -q, -s, -c, or -qr options, but may
specify more if you want.  If you don't want or need to use -if or -id,
you can just provide sample file names on the command line.

The distribution directory also includes the file ttuner_tools.jar.  This
file contains the Java Launcher and Viewer.  These are described in the
PDF file and in the manual.  The Launcher was designed for PC users so
that they can run the basic TraceTuner options without using the MS-DOS
command line.  It may be useful on UNIX as well as it lets you select
input files, run TraceTuner, and then immediately run the Viewer without
having to specify paths.

The Viewer shows the original traces, the original basecalls made by the
ABI basecaller, and the revised basecalls and quality values supplied by
TraceTuner.

To use the Launcher, make sure the ttuner executable is in your path so
the Launcher can find it.  Assuming Java 1.3 is in your path and that 
ttuner_tools.jar file is in your current directory, the command to start 
the Launcher is

    java -jar ttuner_tools.jar -Dhelpdocs.dir="$TTHOME/help"

where "TTHOME" is an environmental variable that should have been set up 
properly during the installation.

To run the stand-alone Viewer on a single sample file / phd file combination
the command would be

    java -Dhelpdocs.dir="$TTHOME/help" -cp ttuner_tools.jar \
	 com.paracel.tt.run.TTView <sample-file> <phd-file>

The Java tools need Java version 1.3 for the UNIX platform to be utilized.
This TraceTuner distribution does not include Java for the UNIX platforms.
If you want to use these tools on a UNIX platform, you need to download and
install the appropriate distribution from

	http://java.sun.com/

If you would like to run the tools from a PC, the file on the CD-ROM that
is named SETUP.EXE under the ttuner2.0.9_x86-win32-4.0 is a PC-style 
installer and does include the necessary runtime Java files for the PC.
