Please record in this file anything sent by engineering to a customer.
Purpose is to keep track of any lookup tables, beta releases, or non-
standard bug fixes.  In particular, make sure anything sent out is tagged
in cvs in some manner and record the cvs tag.  Regular released
distributions do not need to be recorded as these will be sent by
manufacturing.
