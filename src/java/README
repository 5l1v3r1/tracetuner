README for directory java     			          
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The source code in this directory is used to build file ttuner_tools.jar,
which contains the Java Launcher and Viewer. These are described in the
PDF file in directory ../../doc.  The Launcher was designed for PC users so
that they can run the basic TraceTuner options without using the MS-DOS
command line.  It may be useful on UNIX as well as it lets you select
input files, run TraceTuner, and then immediately run the Viewer without
having to specify paths.

The Viewer shows the original traces, the original basecalls made by the
ABI basecaller, and the revised basecalls and quality values supplied by
TraceTuner. It requires sample file and PHD file to run.

To use the Launcher, make sure the ttuner executable is in your path so
the Launcher can find it.  Assuming Java 1.3 is in your path and that 
ttuner_tools.jar file is in your current directory, the command to start 
the Launcher is

    java -jar ttuner_tools.jar -Dhelpdocs.dir="$TTHOME/help"

where "TTHOME" is an environmental variable that should have been set up 
properly during the installation.

To run the stand-alone Viewer on a single sample file / phd file combination
the command would be

    java -Dhelpdocs.dir="$TTHOME/help" -cp ttuner_tools.jar \
	 com.paracel.tt.run.TTView <sample-file> <phd-file>

The Java tools need Java version 1.3 for the UNIX platform to be utilized.
This TraceTuner distribution does not include Java for the UNIX platforms.
If you want to use these tools on a UNIX platform, you need to download and
install the appropriate distribution from
