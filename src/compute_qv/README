This directory contains the source code for building executable ttuner,
which is the main executable of TraceTuner software version 3.0.1. This 
executable
- takes one or more Sanger trace file(s) as input,
- performs processing of the trace data, calls bases and evaluates quality
  value of each base call in a variety of processing modes, and
- outputs results of the processing in a number of different formats.

Many of TraceTuner's command line options and output data formats are similar 
to and compatible with the options/formats available with Phred software 
( http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html ). Examples include the options 
to produce PHD file(s), .qual file(s), .seq file(s), .poly file(s),
etc.  Other options/formats are unique to TraceTuner, such as the option to 
recall Phred's original 'N' calls to the best guess; to use external 
(customized) calibration table for evaluation of quality values; to call 
heterozygotes/mixed bases from dipoloid and mixed DNA samples and evaluate
quality values of all the base calls; or to detect heterozygous indels and
deconvolve the mixed electropherogram into a couple of pure electropherograms
corresponding to the long and short haplotypes.

If invoked without arguments, ttuner will produce a brief usage message:

where 

    -h Displays the detailed help message.

    -Q (quiet) Turns off ttuner's status messages.

    -V (verbose)  Specifies that TraceTuner produce additional
        process status messages. The default (without either the -Q or -V
        option) is level 1. The more V's entered on the command line, 
        the higher the level of verbosity. 
        After level 3 (-VV), there is no change in verbosity. 
        If used in conjunction with the -Q option, the parameter 
        that appears last on the command line takes precedence.

    -nocall This parameter disables TraceTuner base calling and 
        sets the current sequence to the base calls that are read from the 
        input file.  By default, the current sequence is set to the TraceTuner
        base calls.  This parameter cannot be used together with -recalln. 
        If you use -nocall, you will get Ns. 
        If you don't use -nocall, you will not get Ns.

    -recalln This parameter specifies to recall Ns, but not to 
        change, insert or delete any other bases. 
        All bases are relocated to the positions of corresponding peaks. 
        This option cannot be used together with -nocall.

    -edited_bases This option forces TraceTuner to read edited
        base calls and locations from sample file(s) and "start" from them 
        when recalling bases. By default, TraceTuner reads and starts from 
        called bases and locations. 

    -shift This option forces TraceTuner to correct mobility shifts
        in traces.

    -convolved This option forces TraceTuner to use the 'convolved'
        model of peak shape instead of the 'gaussian' model, which is used by
        default. 

    -het Specifies that TraceTuner call heterozygous SNPs using
        IUB Nucleotide Codes and evaluates quality values of these base calls. 
        This option assumes that data in the trace file(s) represent diploid 
        samples, with 50:50 ratio between two haplotypes.

    -mix Specifies that TraceTuner call mixed bases using
        IUB Nucleotide Codes. The processing is similar to that with -het
        option, but does not assume a 50:50 ratio of the (two) haplotypes
        in the sample. Instead, this ratio is determined based on the relative 
        heights of peaks at the mixed call location. 

    -min_ratio <phr> Specifies a threshold ratio of heights of two 
        peaks which may be eventually called as heterozygotes. This parameter 
        will be used only when -het or -mix option is additionally specified.
        If the actual ratio of heights of two peaks is less than the specified
        threshold, then this pair of peaks will not be considered as candidate
        for heterozygous base call. The default value for min_ratio is 0.15

    -trim_window <window_size> Specifies the size of the moving
        average of bases used to trim the ends of a sequence. The default size
        is 10. Trimming stops when the moving average of the quality values
        reaches min_average_quality. Trim data are stored in the .phd output
        file.

    -trim_threshold <min_average_quality> Specifies the threshold
        for the aforementioned quality value moving average. The default value
        is 20.

    -ipd <phd_dir> Specifies that TraceTuner read base calls and 
        locations from external PHD file(s), rather than from sample file(s),
        and use this insormation when recalling bases. The PHD file(s) are 
        supposed to be stored in directory <phd_dir>. Their names should 
        match the names of sample files and have extention .phd.1. 

    -t <lookup_table> Instructs TraceTuner to use the specified 
        "external" calibration lookup table. This option overrides the default 
        (automatic selection of the lookup table) as well as the options -pop5,
        -pop6, -3100, -377dp and -377dt. To get a message indicating which 
        table was actually used, specify -V option

    -C <reference_file> Specifies the file which contains
        FASTA-formatted correct/reference sequence. If either the -tal or
        -tald <dir> option is additionally used, then TraceTuner will
        align the sequence of its base calls with the correct sequence and
        output the result into .tal file

    -cv3 This flag works only with the -c or -cd option. It forces
        ttuner to output version 3 of .scf files. The default output
        of .scf files is version 2.

    -indel_detect Instructs TraceTuner detect small heterozygous 
        indels (<= 100 bp in size) in Sanger trace data and to report the base 
        index in the long read where the indel starts, the indel size (expressed
        as number of scan), the indel start location in electropherogram, and 
        the indel scring.  This option is supposed to be used with diploid 
        samples.

    -indel_resolve Extends option -indel_detect by additionally
        instructing TraceTuner deconvolve the original electropherogram 
        containing indel into two electropherograms corresponding to the 
        long and short reads (if indel is detected). The resulting 
        deconvolved electropherograms will be output to SCF files with the 
        following names: <sample>_long.scf and <sample>_short.scf, where 
        <sample> was a prefix of the name of input sample file, e.g. 
        <sample>.ab1 or <sample>.scf.

    -indloc <loc> Instructs TraceTuner search for indel at the 
        specified location in electropherogram, rather than in the entire
        electropherogram. Must be used together with option -indel_detect 
        or -indel_resolve.

    -indsize <size> Instructs TraceTuner search for indel of 
        specified size (expressed as number of scans). Must be used together 
        with option -indel_detect or -indel_resolve.

    -3730 Instructs TraceTuner to evaluate quality values of called
        bases using the built-in calibration table generated for processing 
        electropherograms produced by ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer. By default, 
        TraceTuner will automatically select the built-in calibration table 
        best matching the processed data from the list of five built-in tables.

    -3700pop5 Analogous to the -3730 option, but instructs
        TraceTuner to evaluate quality values of called bases using the built-in 
        calibration table generated for processing electropherograms produced
        by ABI 3700 DNA Analyzer with POP-5 separation polymer.

    -3700pop6 Analogous to the -3730 option, but instructs
        TraceTuner to evaluate quality values of called bases using the built-in 
        calibration table generated for processing electropherograms produced
        by ABI 3700 DNA Analyzer with POP-6 separation polymer.

    -3100 Analogous to the -3730 option, but instructs 
        TraceTuner to evaluate quality values of called bases using the built-in 
        calibration table generated for processing electropherograms produced
        by ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer.

    -mbace Analogous to the -3730 option, but instructs
        TraceTuner to evaluate quality values of called bases using the built-in
        calibration table generated for processing electropherograms produced
        by MegaBACE DNA Sequencer.

    -p Specifies that TraceTuner output be written to PHD-formatted file(s) in 
        the current working directory. 

    -pd <dir> Analogous to -p, but output file is written to the specified 
        directory.

        file for each sample file to the current working directory.

    -qd <dir> Analogous to -q, but output file is written to the specified 
        directory. 

    -c Specifies that TraceTuner output results in a SCF-formatted file in the
       current working directory. 

    -cd <dir> Analogous to -c, but output file is written to the specified 
        directory. 

    -s Specifies that TraceTuner write its recalled bases in FASTA-formatted 
       sequence file for each sample file in the current working directory.

    -sd <dir> Analogous to -s, but output the FASTA-formatted file to the 
        specified directory.

        detecting polymorphic bases. 

    -dd <dir> Analogous to -d, but output file is written to the specified 
        directory. 

    -qr <output_file> Specifies that TraceTuner write a report file containing 
        statistics on the number of input files that contain bases with QV > 20
        to the specified file. The format of the will be similar to that of 
        qvreport.txt. 

    -hpr Specifies that TraceTuner output HPR (homopolymer run) file
        to the currect working directory. The file includes FASTA header
        followed by four columns of data: homopolymer base, length (that is,
        the number of called identical bases in the row), normalized distance
        between the bases in the homopolymer, and the colaction of the fisrt
        base of the homopolymer in electropherogram.

    -hprd <dir> Analogous to -d, but output HPR file is written to the specified
        directory.

    -sa <file> Specifies that TraceTuner aggregate recalled bases for all
        sample files into a single multi-FASTA formatted sequence file.

    -qa <file> Specifies that TraceTuner aggregate the quality value output for
        all sample files into a single multi-FASTA formattted output file.

    -o <dir> Specifies that TraceTuner output four file to the specified
       output directory. The output files are: multi-FASTA-formatted file of 
       base calls tt.seq, multi-FASTA-formatted file of quality values 
       tt.qual, multi-FASTA-formatted file of called locations tt.loc and
       file tt.status which specifies the status of processing of each sample
       file.

    -tal Specifies that TraceTuner align its base calls with the bases in 
        <consensus_file> and output the results in a file with .tal extension 
        in the sample file directory. The Viewer requires .tal files in order 
        to display the reference sequences.

        specified directory. 

    -tab Specifies that TraceTuner output the alternative base calls in a 
        file with .tab extension in the sample file directory. The Viewer 
        requires .tab files in order to display TraceTuner alternative base 
        calls. This option works only together with -het or -mix option  

    -tabd <dir> Analogous to -tab, but results are written to a file in the 
        specified directory. 

    -ipd <dir> Instructs TraceTuner to read the original base calls and

        file(s). The .phd file(s) should be located in the specified 
        directory <phd_dir> and have name(s) which matches the name(s) 
        of the input sample file(s). This option allows using Phred's base 
        calls and locations or starting from them when recalling bases. 

    -id <dir> Specifies that TraceTuner process every file in the specified 
        directory. 

    -if <file_of_files> Specifies that TraceTuner read file_of_files and treat
