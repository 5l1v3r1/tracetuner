VARtuner is a set of tools for reference-guided assembly of (clonally 
amplified or mixed) DNA reads and detection of variants from this assembly. 

The tools take as input an alignment of (clonally amplified or mixed) reads 
to a reference sequence, assemble the reads and determine a consensus sequence 
from this assembly. The alignment file can be produced by executable trainphd 
with option -t <tab_dir>. 

Example. 
--------
Program GetVARReport.pl stored in this cvs directory reports the high-quality 
differences between the mixed consensus sequence and the reference sequence.

Assuming your mixed Sanger samples are stored in directory ./chromat_dir, 
executables ttuner and trainphd are in current directory and the reference 
sequence is stored in file ./Ref_seq.txt, the variant report can be generated 
using the following series of commands:

mkdir phd_dir tab_dir
 
ttuner -3100 -pd phd_dir -mix -tabd tab_dir -id chromat_dir

trainphd -C Ref_seq.txt -t tab_dir -d phd_dir > trainphd.out

GetVARReport.pl  Ref_seq.txt trainphd.out > VAR_report.txt

The VAR report comprises five columns: (1) position in the reference sequence, 
(2) base of the reference sequence, (3) the corresponding base in the new 
consensus sequence, (4) quality value of the base in consensus sequence and, 
if available, (5) an alternative consensus base.
